This extension was no longer maintained by the Magento team. It was provided only for backward compatibility and is not tested with recent Magento releases.

We made it Magento 1.7 compatible and have successfully migrated one osCommerce store with customer, order, product and category data.

If you're interested to contribute, feel free to do so ;-)
